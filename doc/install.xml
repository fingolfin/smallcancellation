After unpacking the archive, go to the newly created <F>smallcancellation</F>  directory
and call <C>./configure</C> to use the default <C>../..</C> path to the
&GAP; home directory or <C>./configure <A>path</A></C> where <A>path</A> is 
the path to the &GAP; home directory, if the package is being installed in a 
non-default location. So for example if you install the package in the
<F>~/.gap/pkg</F> directory and the &GAP; home directory is <F>~/gap4r5</F>
then you have to call
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
./configure ../../../gap4r5/
]]></Log>
<P/>
This will fetch the architecture type for which &GAP; has been compiled
last and create a <F>Makefile</F>. Now simply call
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
make
]]></Log>
<P/>
to compile the binary and to install it in the appropriate place.<P/>

If &GAP; cannot find a working binary, some computations may take more time (specially for large presentations).

<Heading>Loading the <Package>SmallCancellation</Package> Package </Heading>

To use the <Package>SmallCancellation</Package> Package you have to request it explicitly. This  is
done by calling <Ref Func="LoadPackage" BookName="ref"/>:
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> LoadPackage("smallcancellation");

Loading  SmallCancellation 1.0.2

]]></Example>
<P/>

The <Package>SmallCancellation</Package> requires the <Package>Grape</Package> Package (version >=4.7).<P/>

If you want to load the <Package>SmallCancellation</Package> package by default, you  can  put  the
<C>LoadPackage</C> command  into  your  <F>gaprc</F>  file  
(see  Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="The gap.ini and gaprc files" BookName="ref"/>).
